# Breakdowns

Breakdowns are complex programming exercises broken down to varying levels. You
can use these if when you are programming you tend to get stuck or go around
in circles.

They are intended for use by learners who have encountered obstacles learning to
code, and with direct coach supervision.

Each exercise has its own instructions that you can find in the README or spec
file.

## General rules

* **You should understand the code you write.**
  If you feel yourself shifting into a 'just trying things out' mode you are
  probably not in the right zone for learning. If you do make it work, you will
  have no good explanation as to why.

* **You should talk to a coach if you don't understand.**
  Don't just try random stuff for ages. If you can't contact a coach, stop
  programming these tasks and wait until you can. The more time you spend going
  around in circles the more you will learn to go around in circles.

* **You should follow the rules.**
  The rules are there to keep you on the right track and ensure you can switch
  out of faulty approaches.

## The theory behind it

To learn things have to go right. You must find some measure of success in the
tasks you are trying to learn from, otherwise you will only learn wrong ways and
not right ways.

By narrowing down the scope and prior learning required to 'get to green' it
will be easier to do so, and thereby learn the things you need to learn to move
onto more complex tasks.
